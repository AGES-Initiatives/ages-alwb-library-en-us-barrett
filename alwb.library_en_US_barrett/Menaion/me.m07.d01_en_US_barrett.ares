meMA.Ode3KathismaT.text = "We, all the generations of humanity, bless you as the Virgin and alone among women who gave birth to God incarnate upon the earth without seed. For the fire of the Godhead descended to dwell in you, and you nurse the Creator and Lord as an infant. Thus, with all of the Angels, all we on earth worthily give glory to the All-holy Child born from you, and we cry to you with one voice: O immaculate and spotless Lady, intercede with your Son and God that He grant forgiveness of offences to those who flee in faith to your shelter."
